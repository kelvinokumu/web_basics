        <h3>John Doe</h3>
        <p>Hi, I'm John Doe, a passionate and detail-oriented web developer with a focus on front-end development. I have been in the industry for over 5 years, working on various projects and collaborating with clients to bring their ideas to life.</p>
        <p>I have a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I keep myself updated with the latest trends and technologies. I am experienced in using frameworks and libraries such as Bootstrap and React to create responsive and interactive websites.</p>
        <p>My goal is to create visually appealing and user-friendly websites that not only meet the clients' needs but also provide an enjoyable browsing experience for the users. I pay attention to every detail, from the layout and design to the functionality and performance of the website.</p>
        <p>Outside of work, I enjoy staying active in the web development community, attending conferences and meetups, and contributing to open-source projects. I believe in continuous learning and improvement, always striving to enhance my skills and explore new possibilities in web development.</p>
